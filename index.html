    	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>I am a graphic designer, car lover, and a sports enthusiast. I like energetic work that shows movement through geometry and work that shows boldness through high contrast. Communicating intensity and the dauntless ambition of your strategy to your audience is my favorite part of designing, because it is a good feeling when your design hits that audience and it does what it was intended to do. As a designer Iâ€™m versatile in my work, though I tend to work towards more print oriented work.</p>
